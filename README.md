# GameDome
 The "Game Dome" project is a game launcher that includes four different games, showcasing my understanding and application of OOP principles. The games included are:  Gerangelo: A word unscrambling game. Rock, Paper, Scissors: The classic game of chance. 7 Up 7 Down: A dice game based on predicting the sum. SOS: A strategic word game.
